  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <p>Tender, juicy, delicious - just a few words to describe these ribs. My dad taught me how to make these! Everyone loves
  them!</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 racks ribs, membrane on bone side removed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon steak seasoning, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup water, or more as needed</li>
    <li>Â½ cup barbeque sauce, or to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat grill for low heat.</li>
    <li>Cut ribs in half and season with steak seasoning. Place ribs, bone-side down, in a foil pan; add water. Cover pan with a
    sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Cook ribs on the preheated grill, adding water every hour if liquid has evaporated, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. Add barbeque
    sauce to ribs and continue cooking for 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read
    145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
  </ol>
