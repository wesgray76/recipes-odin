  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Place the chicken breasts in the slow cooker. Sprinkle with the salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, and garlic powder.</li>
   <li>Spread the soup over the top of the chicken.</li>
   <li>Add the sliced butter on top of the soup layer.</li>
   <li>Mix together the bouillon and chicken broth to dissolve it. Then pour over chicken/soup layers.</li>
   <li>Place the lid on the crock and cook on Low for 4-6 hours, or until chicken is done and can be easily shredded.</li>
   <li>Remove the chicken to a plate using tongs. Cover and set aside.</li>
   <li>Add the noodles to the soup mixture (and frozen veggies, if using). Stir well. Place the lid back on and cook on High
  for another 1-2 hours, stirring halfway through cook time.
  
  If using dry Egg Noodles, add them about 12-15 minutes before serving. Stir them in and place the lid back on. Or boil
  them on the stove and add them before serving.
</li>
   <li>Meanwhile, use two forks to shred the chicken. Then cover so it doesn't dry out.</li>
   <li>When the noodles are done, Add the shredded chicken to the crock and mix well. If the chicken and noodles is too thick
  for your liking, just add some hot water or broth.</li>
   <li>Serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
